Tea leaf Diseases Detection
Solution pipeline has three main stages.
Acquisition of tea leaf data onground with a controllable UAV
(or other data acquisition hardware initially), processing of the acquired data with 
computer vision and remote sensing techniques, and the Artificial Intelligence driven decision algorithm 
development based on deep learning standards, which gives the desired quality control. 
Each stage has iterative evaluations, 
thus, this is a cyclic flow with continuous integration,
which allows a constant model improvement and quality of the proposed solution pipeline.
